# Face-Recognition-with-PCA
Facial recognition performed using principle component analysis

To perform the facial recognition, a subset of images from the FaceScrub database must be downloaded:


http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/320/proj3/faces_subset.txt


The code will extract the images linked to from the above text file.


For this code to run successfully, folders by the name of 'uncropped', 'cropped', 'resized', 'validation', 'training', and 'test' need to already be existing in the current directory.
